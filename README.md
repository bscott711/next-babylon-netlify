# IIBR

## Interactive isosurfaces using babylonjs rendering

This package provides a utility to add an interactive rendering environment to static HTML pages. Can be displayed inline as an iFrame so it can be a swap for a movie (.mp4/avi)

## Example Usage

 Using git-lfs we can manage the 'large files' in a robust manner.
 Can be track directory tree, or all files of a given type

    git lfs track "assets/**"
    git lfs track "*.glb"
    git add .gitattributes

Adding files to the lfs results in the following URL for files.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
